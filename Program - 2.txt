<p> 
The <I>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language </I>
for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages 
such as JavaScript. Some Basic tags are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>HEAD</li>
<li>BODY</li>
<li>TITLE</li>

<p style="font-Times New Roman" ;"font-size:11px" >
To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the 
abbreviation:Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order 
to connect related items Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in 
hardcopy or soft copy format Language: a language that a computer system understands and 
uses to interpret commands. HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone 
is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies 
such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.
In this case, I like to break down the three technologies ? HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ? this 
way: they are like a human body. HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, and JavaScript is the 
circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.
You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, 
CSS is the interior and exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many 
other functional features that make the house livable.
